# Info:
The real question here, is what doesn't he do?  
He keeps track of your bulges, so you don't have to!

Count the bulges with **!bulgecount**  
See global stats with **!globalbulgecount**

He also keeps track of the amount of time a channel can go without saying the forbidden word.  
_"But what might this forbidden word be?"_ you might ask. Well if I tell you that, that would ruin the purpose.
